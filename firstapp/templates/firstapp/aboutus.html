			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<div class='panel_l' ><br />
			<div class='post' >
				<style="font-size:36px;"> Maid in Mumbai provides informal laborers a chance to a better life. By providing them employment, we ensure their rights, standard wages, as well as employment benefits aimed at their entire family. These include health insurance, life insurance, day care for their children, vocational training, etc.
 <br />
Employers for our maids are not left alone either by employing maids from us, they are ensured a thorough background check on their maid, round-the-clock maid replacements, as well as on-demand maid supply for all their needs.
 <br />
This symbiotic relationship has flourished over the past 4 years we have grown from 2 maids in 2009 to over 250 maids in 2013! Furthermore, our maids lives have been impacted in unimaginable ways.
  <br />
Although we measure our impact in several ways, our most important success metrics are about how we empower our maids.
<ul><li><style="font-size:12px;">60% maids opened their first bank accounts through Decimal Foundation at Punjab National bank, making them eligible for a Rs 50,000 risk cover, along with a zero-balance savings account. These maids now receive their entire salary as a direct deposit to the account.</li>
<li><style="font-size:12px;">All maids go through basic vocational training, to get trained in basic chores (dusting, sweeping/mopping etc). They also learn about financial management, women’s rights etc.</li>
<li><style="font-size:12px;">About 20 maids went through our first pilot of specialized training for cooking, child care, elderly care, festival cleaning, language training etc. With support from UnLtd India, this successful pilot will be expanded to all other before the end of the year.</li>
<li><style="font-size:12px;">40% maids invested in their first life insurance/savings scheme policy with LIC, or PNB, where a fixed portion of their monthly income was earmarked for these savings.</li></ul>
